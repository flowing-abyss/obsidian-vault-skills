# Obsidian Structure

Two modes:
1. **Reference** — static info about vault layout, hierarchy rules, restricted directories.
2. **Analyze** — run the bundled script to get the real vault tree, then audit it inline.

## DO NOT MODIFY

These directories and files are human-only. Never create, edit, or delete anything inside them:

- `base/categories/` — global category definitions
- `home/databases/`
- `home/prefixes.md`
- `templates/`
- `classes/`
- `periodic/statuses/`

## Directory Map

| Path                | Contents                                      | Agent creates here? |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `base/notes/`       | Knowledge notes                               | **YES — primary**   |
| `base/_hierarchy/`  | Hierarchical aggregator notes                 | Yes                 |
| `base/_meta-notes/` | Thematic hubs / roadmaps                      | Yes                 |
| `base/_problems/`   | Specific research questions                   | Yes                 |
| `base/contacts/`    | People notes                                  | Yes                 |
| `base/creators/`    | Creator / author profiles                     | Yes                 |
| `base/productions/` | Companies / organizations                     | Yes                 |
| `base/additions/`   | Experiments, meetings, reports                | Yes                 |
| `base/categories/`  | Global directions                             | **NO**              |
| `sources/`          | Books, articles, videos, papers               | Yes                 |
| `projects/`         | Project management notes                      | Yes                 |
| `periodic/`         | Daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly / yearly | Yes                 |
| `files/`            | Images, PDFs, attachments                     | Yes (files only)    |

## Knowledge Hierarchy

The vault organizes knowledge through a strict dependency chain:

```
Category → Meta-note → Problem → Hierarchy
```

- **Category** — the base unit. Human-only — agent never creates these.
	- **Meta-note** — must link to exactly one existing category.
		- **Problem** — must link to exactly one existing meta-note AND must use the **same category** as that meta-note.
- **Hierarchy** — can link to a category, a meta-note, or a problem. When linking to a meta-note or problem, always use the same category they belong to.

## Understanding and Advising on the Actual Vault Structure

When the user asks anything about their real vault — where to put a note, how to reorganize an area, what's missing, how something fits — first run the script to load the live structure into context:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/obsidian-structure/scripts/structure.py
```

The script outputs the full vault tree. Use it to understand what actually exists before giving any advice. Do not annotate or score the output — it's context for you, not a report for the user.

### How to advise

After loading the structure, ask 1–2 targeted questions to understand the user's goal before making recommendations. Good guiding questions:

- "What are you trying to improve — navigation, coverage, naming, or something specific?"
- "Are you adding a new node or rethinking an existing one?"
- "Which area of the vault concerns you most?"

Then give concrete, context-aware advice grounded in the actual tree. Reference real node names from the script output.

### Structural principles to apply

Use these as a compass, not a rulebook. The user knows their context better than you.

**🗺️ Category** — the main dashboard and global entry point into a domain. A powerful container: it shows tables of sources, projects, people, and a Mermaid diagram of everything inside. Categories are classifiers — they're used to filter and query across the vault. They're stable and limited in number; even starting with just `work` and `study` is enough. The name should feel like a "department" — but the user decides what counts as a department for them. A specific technology (`python`, `js`) is a valid category if it's a major context the user lives in.

**🔎 Meta-note** — a thematic hub or roadmap for ongoing research inside a category. This is "I'm studying X" — it scopes a direction worth sustained attention. A meta-note is NOT a plan, a log, or a single resource. It's where the user tracks the landscape of a topic and links related problems and hierarchies. Must belong to a category.

**⚡ Problem** — a decomposed sub-problem of the meta-note's research. Think of it as breaking down a research challenge into tractable components: not "how to do X", but the concrete problems that need to be solved within the research. In the medical AI example: "AI diagnosis", "identification of symptoms", "patient information based on data" — each is a distinct sub-problem of the larger research. Must belong to both a category and a meta-note.

**🧬 Hierarchy** — an aggregator of atomic notes sharing a common attribute. This is where synthesis happens. Unlike categories/meta-notes/problems (which are classifiers for filtering sources and projects), hierarchies hold the actual knowledge: they collect wikilinks to notes by theme, attribute, or keyword. Can be nested freely — this is the safe zone for adding depth. A hierarchy can also implement a Discourse Graph structure. Must have at least a category in its metadata.

Nesting law (hard rule, not heuristic):
1. 🗺️ → children: 🔎, 🧬
2. 🔎 → children: ⚡, 🧬
3. ⚡ → children: 🧬
4. 🧬 → children: 🧬 only (no 🗺️/🔎/⚡ inside)

### Examples

R&D decomposition with problems:
```
🗺️ artificial intelligence
  └── 🔎 AI-powered medical decision support
        ├── ⚡ search for a patient in the database
        ├── ⚡ identification of symptoms
        ├── ⚡ AI diagnosis
        └── ⚡ AI treatment planning
```

Deep knowledge synthesis with nested hierarchies:
```
🗺️ history
  ├── 🔎 historiography
  │     ├── 🧬 analysis of historical processes
  │     └── 🧬 interpretation of historical processes
  └── 🔎 methodology of history
        └── 🧬 methods of historical research
              ├── 🧬 comparative analysis in history
              └── 🧬 archival research in history
```

In the second example, `historiography` is the meta-note (the hub), and the 🧬 nodes are aggregators of atomic notes pulled from dozens of sources — they're not section headers, they're note collections.
